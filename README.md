# ACIT 2911 PROJECT

This is the group 11, set B acit 2911 project.
In this project we have created a pet adoption application
that allows for adopters to view and contact shelters about currently adoptable pets
and for shelters to create accounts, log in with their contact details,
and enter information about the pets that they currently have up for adoption.
